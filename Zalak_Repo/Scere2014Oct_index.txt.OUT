FANMOD 1.1 subgraph enumeration
-------------------------------

Network name: C:\Zalak\CSS 595 Project\GitHub\Zalak_Repo\Scere2014Oct_index.txt
Network type: Directed
Number of nodes: 5131
Number of edges: 22441
Number of single edges: 22441
Number of mutual edges: 0

Algorithm: enumeration
Subgraph size: 3

Generated 1000 random networks
   with locally constant number of bidirectional edges,
   3 exchanges per edge and 3 tries per edge.

764600 subgraphs were enumerated in the original network.
783675864 subgraphs were enumerated in the random networks.
784440464 subgraphs were enumerated in all networks.

For the random networks: 71949589 tries were made, 67333419 were successful.
Randomization took 145.252 seconds.
Enumeration took 850.184 seconds.
